# Competitive Programming

This is an archive of my competative programming codes.

## [LightOJ](http://lightoj.com)

This is a Bangladeshi online judge. I actually love this OJ because of its well organised catagories.
I started solving in thin OJ when I was in **Class 10**. Love it since then. My common work flow is
learning an algorithm and solving the catagories of LightOJ.

## [UVaOJ](http://lightoj.com)

I personally don't like UVa. It looks clumsy to me. Thats why did not solve much of UVa!

## [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

I learnt about Leetcode from youtube. Its a good place to practice interview type problems.
